        <h3>A dedicated Digital Crafts-man based in London, England üìç</h3>
        <p>
          A passionate junior front-end developer based in the heart of London,
          England. My journey in web development started with the basics: HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript. I quickly fell in love with the endless
          possibilities of the web and expanded my skills to include modern
          tools like React, Tailwind, and SCSS. With a knack for designing and
          maintaining responsive websites, I strive to create smooth user
          experiences and dynamic, engaging interfaces. My focus is always on
          writing clean, optimized code, leveraging cutting-edge development
          tools and techniques. But I'm not just a coder ‚Äì I believe in the
          power of teamwork. Collaborating with diverse teams to produce
          outstanding web applications is where I really thrive. Looking to
          create something amazing? Let's connect!
