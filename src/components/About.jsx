        <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
        <h3>A Digital Craftsman, an Information Marksman based in London, England üìç</h3>
        <p>
       Greetings straight outta the murky depths of London (it's mostly rain). I'm the junior front-end developer you're reading about. My journey into the world of web development started in the most groundbreaking way imaginable: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was an exhilarating ride, akin to watching paint dry, but in RGB.
       <br></br> <br/>

       I've since expanded my arsenal with tools like React, Tailwind, and SCSS. These are the tools that help me turn the mundane into the slightly-less mundane, crafting websites that respond with the enthusiasm of a British royal guard. My aim? To create user experiences that are as seamless as my tea-making routine.
  <br></br> <br/>

         But don't be fooled, I'm more than a semi-colon enthusiast. My real talent lies in blending into teams like a chameleon, only less colourful and more focused on producing exceptional web applications. It's the kind of collaboration that's as exciting as discussing the weather in an elevator.
       <br></br> <br/>
       So, if you're interested in creating digital experiences with someone who considers coding a wild Friday night, let's connect. We can push the boundaries of web development, or at least nudge them gently.
  <br></br> <br/>
Lastly, all the projects you see here, including this site, are hand-crafted from scratch ‚Äì no templates, no tutorials.
